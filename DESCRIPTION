Description: A rank-based variable selection procedure is developed for the semiparametric accelerated
failure time model with interval-censored observations where the l1 penalized likelihood (partial
likelihood) method is applicable, which is not available for oracle property and limited robustness
for heavy-tailed errors and outliers.
The new method penalizes the Rank-type loss function for interval-censored data with the
scad penalty, which has oracle property and a non-convex penalty function. To correctly choose
the tuning parameters, a generalized CV and BIC criterion are proposed. Desirable properties
of the estimator, such as the oracle properties, are established through the local quadratic
expansion of the Rank loss function.
In particular, our method can be easily implemented by the standard linear programming
packages and hence numerically convenient.
